## Submit Changes

TODO How to do a PR


## Code Style

This project adheres to [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the
notable exception that line length is irrelevant. 
Most lines are under 100 characters, but are not nessessarily restricted to that.

The ability to comprehend the code is the only thing that matters.


## Documentation

Link: [**https://docs.bolt.bot**](https://docs.bolt.bot)

This project uses [Gitbook](gitbook.com) for documentation,
backed by Github in this repo's `/docs` directory. 

The documentation is targeted at a developer using Bolt. 

**Documentation Goals**:
- Users should experience success in < 30 minutes
- Ability to dive into advanced usage
- Reference
    - Function interfaces
    - Constants


## Setup Development Environment

This project uses [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

Install pipenv then run:
```bash
$ pipenv install --dev
```


## Run Tests

Make sure your [development environment](#setup-development-environment) is setup.

```bash
$ pipenv run tests
```


## Build Release Artifact

Bolt can be distributed bundles:
- RPM
- DEB
- TAR.GZ
- Docker

Scripts exist to do this automatically. 

Make sure your [development environment](#setup-development-environment) is setup.

```bash
$ pipenv run build [RPM|DEB|TAR|BIN|DOCKER]
```

## Versioning

This project follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) standard.

This project uses [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) to automatically
bump the version, set the version string in certain files, adds git tags and special bump version commits.

```bash
$ pipenv run bump [major|minor|patch]
```

When to bump:
- **Major**: Backward-incompatible changes, feature deletion, or depecration. *This should happen sparingly*
- **Minor**: New features or enhancements
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, security patches
