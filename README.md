# About Bolt

Bolt is an extensible chatbot written entirely in Python, inspired by
[Errbot](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) projects.
The goal of this project is to provide a simple to extend bot framework for
[Discord](https://discordapp.com).

Batteries included:
* [Simple command creation](#Command-creation)
* [Hook any event from Discord](#Hook-Discord-Event)
* [Receive data ingress with webhooks](#Webhook)
* [Run code on a set interval](#Code-interval)
* [Schedule code to be run after a time period](#Database-Interaction)
* [Simple database interaction with MongoDB](#Schedule-code-to-run)
* [Intuitive Discord object mapping](#Discord-object-mapping)
* [Bundled in standardized distribution formats](#Installing)

I am open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue :)

Bolt originally started out as a simple Trivia Bot that used long polling and webhooks to read and
write to chat channels. I became obsessed with making this bot more robust and at that time, no bots
existed for Discord, so this bot evolved into a fully vetted framework that I could use to build
functionality off of.

This project is a place I can experiment with design ideas and evolve a sense of personal code
standards. I treat it as an academic project to learn about new libraries and tools available to me
as Python continues to grow.

# Examples

## Command creation
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import command

class SomePlugin(Plugin):
    @command("hi")
    def on_sayhi(self, event):
        self.say(event.channel_id, f"Hello {event.sender.name}")
```

## Hook Discord Event
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import subscriber
from bolt.discord import Events

class SomePlugin(Plugin):
    @subscriber(Events.MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD)
    def on_message_reaction_add(self, event):
        # do stuff
```

## Webhook
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import webhook

class SomePlugin(Plugin):
    @webhook('/hookme', methods=['GET'])
       def webhook(self, request):
           # do stuff
```

## Code interval
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import interval

class SomePlugin(Plugin):
    @interval(60)
    def updateathing(self, event):
        # do stuff
```

## Database Interaction
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import command

class SomePlugin(Plugin):
    def activate(self):
        self.users = self.bot.database_client['plugin-users']

    @command("whoami")
    def whoami(self, event):
        author = self.users.find_one({"id": event.author.id})
```

## Schedule code to run
