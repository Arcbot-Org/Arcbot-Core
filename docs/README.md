**Bolt** is an extensible chat bot written in Python, inspired by [Errbot](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) projects. The goal of this project is to provide a simple to extend bot framework for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).

Bolt originally started out as a simple Trivia Bot that used long polling and webhooks to read and write to chat channels. 

I became obsessed with making this bot more robust and at that time, no bots existed for Discord, so this bot evolved into a fully vetted framework that I could use to build functionality off of. 

This project is a place I can experiment with design ideas and evolve a sense of personal code standards. I treat it more as an academic project to learn about new libraries and tools available to me as Python continues to grow.
