### Basic Commands
```python
from bolt import Plugin
from bolt import command

class SayHi(Plugin):
    @command("hi")
    def hi(self, event):
        self.say(event.channel_id, f"Hello {event.sender.name}")
```

This will register a command with the bot's plugin manager.

If someone says "hi" in a text channel that the bot is in; then the decorated function will execute.
Commands themselves don't remember state, unless persisted to the database or set state on the
plugin class itself. It is recommended that you use the database for most stateful things.
